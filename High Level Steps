This repository includes configuration files and step by step guidelines on how to setup a prometheus - grafana - alertmanager monitoring and alerting system for a flask web app, deployed on an ec2 Instance.

High Level Steps
1. For flask app deployment to ec2 instance, you can check my other repo: https://github.com/EngineerMarion29/deploy_flask_to_aws_ec2
2. Create new ec2 instance that will house prometheus, grafana and alertmanager services.
3. Install node exporter to the instances that you would like to have monitoring.
4. Open ports 9090, 9100, 9093, 3000 for the prometheus, grafana and alertmanager services.
5. Install prometheus, grafana and alertmanager services.
6. Set alerting rules to be used by alertmanager 
7. Edit prometheus.yml to ensure prometheus will send the necessary alert rules to alertmanager
8. Create a yml config file that will contain information to which stream will the alert be sent to.
